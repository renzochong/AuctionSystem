# AuctionSystem
Auction system for any type of vehicle or machine which can help and facilitate sellers to have a safe transaction

For this project I'm thinking on building am Auction system for motorcycles, cars or other type of machines. Browsing through the internet all you find is crashed or salvage vehicles being sold in actions, but there is nothing like eBay where people can sell new and used items that don't required any type of major repairs such is in the case of motorcycles or cars. 

I was thinking on starting small to first target motorcycles, since I can speak for experience owning and trying to sell one. The idea would be to have the seller register the motorcycle by creating an account and entering all the necessary information about it. What would make it useful and unique is that each seller will need to validate his information by providing a valid ID. Now days we see people selling vehicles on online market places such as Facebook and Craigslist where the sellers are exposed to scammers, and false profiles. There will be a way to register the user, item, bid, and transaction which then all will be validated before a transaction can be done. 

As mentioned before there are other websites with similar capabilities but there is nothing out there for people trying to sell their used machines, and keep them save from scammers or third-party trying to send invalid offers that end on stealing the sellers information. Of course there are other websites where people can go and get an offer from a corporation to by their machines, and even offer pick up from their door, but these usually end on low values for the customers machines as these companies want to profit out of the item. 

I think a web app like this will be solving the problem for people that are trying to sell their machines on and get the best offers without having to deal with scammers and low offers.
